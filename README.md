## 🏗️ Development Phases

### 🟢 Phase 1 — Hardware + Backend Test Environment

Focused on validating the full sensor-to-database pipeline in isolation before cloud deployment.

**Goals:**
- Sensor integration with ESP32
- WiFi communication verification
- JSON transmission testing
- Database insertion and query validation via pgAdmin 4

**Test Architecture:**
```
ESP32  →  backend-test (Node.js @ Port 6000)  →  PostgreSQL (iot-test-env)
```

**Test Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_test_data (
    id          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    temperature FLOAT,
    humidity    FLOAT,
    air_quality INT,
    created_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**ESP32 JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "temperature": 27.4,
  "humidity": 61.2,
  "air_quality": 1432
}
```

---

### 📊 Phase 1 — pgAdmin Database Verification

All three sensor metrics were verified live in **pgAdmin 4** connected to `iot-test-env` PostgreSQL 18, running `SELECT * FROM sensor_test_data` (56 total rows, query completed in 0.151s).

---

#### 🌡️ Temperature Data — Line Chart (pgAdmin Graph Visualiser)

![Temperature Graph](backend-test/results/pgadminbackendtestDHT11temperaturegraph.png)

> DHT11 temperature readings plotted as a **Line Chart** (Y Axis: `temperature`, X Axis: `id`). The line stays consistently flat between **27–30°C** across all 56 rows, confirming stable sensor readings from the ESP32 in the test environment.

---

#### 💧 Humidity Data — Bar Chart (pgAdmin Graph Visualiser)

![Humidity Graph](backend-test/results/pgadminbackendtestDHT11humiditygraph.png)

> DHT11 humidity readings plotted as a **Bar Chart** (Y Axis: `humidity`, X Axis: `id`). Values vary between **45–82%** across 56 records, with visible spikes around rows 22–26 and 36–40, demonstrating real environmental humidity fluctuation captured by the sensor.

---

#### 🌫️ Air Quality Data — Bar Chart (pgAdmin Graph Visualiser)

![Air Quality Graph](backend-test/results/pgadminbackendtestMQ135airqualitygraph.png)

> MQ135 air quality readings plotted as a **Bar Chart** (Y Axis: `air_quality`, X Axis: `id`). Values range from **~1200 to ~1900**, with a prominent spike around rows 20–22 reaching near 2000, confirming the MQ135 sensor is detecting real air quality variations and the data pipeline is fully functional end-to-end.

---

### 🔵 Phase 2–3 — UI Development

Initial and updated frontend dashboard built with HTML5, CSS3, and Chart.js across two iteration phases.

---

### 🔵 Phase 4 — Production Backend

After Phase 1 validation, the backend was refactored into a production-ready structure.

**Backend Stack:**

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `Node.js` | Runtime |
| `Express.js` | REST API framework |
| `pg` (node-postgres) | PostgreSQL driver |
| `dotenv` | Environment variable management |
| `cors` | Cross-origin request handling |

**Environment Variables:**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
PORT=5000
```

---

### 🟣 Phase 5–6 — Cloud Deployment

| Service | Platform | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Backend API | **Render** | Auto-deploy from GitHub |
| Database | **Supabase** | Managed PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | **Netlify** | Static site hosting |

**Netlify Configuration:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Base Directory | `frontend` |
| Publish Directory | `.` |
| Build Command | *(empty)* |

---

### 🟡 Phase 7–8 — Final Frontend + Netlify Integration

Full Render backend + Netlify deployment with confirmed live data flow, polished UI, AQI alerts, health scores, and CSV export.

**Features Implemented:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🌡️ Temperature Card | Live reading with min/avg/max + sparkline |
| 💧 Humidity Card | Live reading with min/avg/max + sparkline |
| 🌫️ AQI Card | Color-coded glow border (Clean/Moderate/Poor) |
| 🎯 Health Score Gauge | Circular donut gauge with composite score |

| 🎛️ Sensor Gauges | Arc-style gauges for Temperature, Humidity, AQI |
| 📍 Location Detection | Auto-detected city shown in the header |
| 📱 Responsive Design | Mobile + desktop layouts |

---

### 🟢 Phase 9 — Frontend Optimization & Localization

Focused on highly improving data loading speeds, graph visualization, localization, and dashboard robustness.
- **24-Hour Master Chart:** Pinned a fixed `00:00–23:00` axis where missing records render accurately as line gaps (`spanGaps: false`). Removed chart animation delays for instant rendering.
- **Parallel Fetch & Caching:** Routed around API latency by racing endpoints (`Promise.any()`) and caching raw data for 60 seconds, preventing redundant network calls when switching dates or auto-refreshing.
- **Keyless Geocoding API:** Migrated from Google Maps to totally free APIs using Photon (OSM) for location autocomplete and BigDataCloud for precise reverse-geocoding without API keys.
- **Offline Resilience:** Increased the online/offline connection threshold to 6 minutes. Ensured that during temporary device offline states, the dashboard retains and displays the last known sensor data rather than clearing to empty states (`--`).
- **Data Continuity in Graphs:** Fixed chart rendering logic so data lines remain continuous and do not vanish when new data points are temporarily unavailable. Master graph lines restored to clean, single-color aesthetics.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Implemented **premium glassmorphism** styling across dashboard cards, alert panels, and the AQI banner. Removed the unused battery status display and optimized layout spacing. Eliminated flickering issues in the news ticker to ensure a smooth, professional data stream.

---

### 🟢 Phase 10 — Serverless Alerting System (Email & SMS)

Allows users to receive direct notifications for bad AQI thresholds purely via the frontend, avoiding backend mailing infrastructure.
- **EmailJS Integration:** Built a fully client-side alerting framework hooking into `EmailJS`, dynamically passing customized text blocks (`{{aqi}}`, `{{threshold}}`) whenever the dashboard picks up hazardous spikes.
- **SMS Gateway Routing [Testing]:** Overcame global CORS limits and restrictive third-party REST APIs by routing free SMS alerts through standard mobile carrier email-to-SMS gateways straight from the browser.

---

### 🟢 Phase 11 — Database Migration & Backend Redeployment (NeonDB)

Migrated the primary PostgreSQL database infrastructure to NeonDB to avoid Supabase's restrictive egress limits and optimize connection pooling, serverless scaling, and backend reliability.

#### ⚠️ Why We Migrated Away from Supabase to NeonDB

During Phase 10, the system was running on **Supabase's free-tier PostgreSQL**. As the ESP32 began posting sensor data every 5 seconds continuously, we hit a critical infrastructure wall:

| Problem | Root Cause |
|---------|-----------|
| 🔴 **Egress Limit Exhausted** | Supabase free tier caps outbound data transfer. With readings every 5s + frontend polling `/api/latest` and `/api/history` constantly, bandwidth drained within days. |
| 🔴 **Connection Pooling Drops** | Supabase's free tier enforces strict connection limits. The Render backend's persistent `pg` connections would get killed during traffic spikes, causing `ECONNRESET` errors and data loss. |
| 🔴 **Cold Start Latency** | Supabase projects on the free tier pause after inactivity. This caused noticeable delays after the ESP32 reconnected post-sleep cycles. |
| 🟡 **No Serverless Edge Support** | For future scaling and edge compute plans, Supabase's architecture was limiting. |

#### ✅ Why NeonDB Was Chosen

**NeonDB** is a **serverless PostgreSQL** platform built on top of a branching storage engine (copy-on-write). It was the ideal replacement because:

- **No egress throttling** on the free tier for our use-case workload
- **Autoscaling compute** — the database scales to zero when idle and spins up instantly on demand (no cold start delays)
- **Connection pooling built-in** via PgBouncer-compatible pooling, eliminating `ECONNRESET` drops under Render's stateless environment
- **Identical PostgreSQL dialect** — zero schema changes required, only the `DATABASE_URL` connection string was swapped
- **Branching support** — NeonDB's branch-per-environment model will enable clean staging/production DB splits in future phases

#### 🔄 Migration Steps Performed

```
1. Exported full sensor_data table from Supabase via pg_dump
2. Created new NeonDB project + database
3. Imported schema + data via psql
4. Updated .env DATABASE_URL on Render to point to NeonDB
5. Redeployed backend on Render — zero downtime
6. Verified data integrity via SELECT COUNT(*) and spot checks
7. Monitored for 48h — no connection drops, no egress warnings
```

#### 📊 NeonDB Dashboard — Live Connection Monitor

> The NeonDB dashboard showing active compute, connection pooling status, and database metrics post-migration:

![NeonDB Dashboard](screenshots/neon-db-dashboard.png)

- **NeonDB Integration:** Replaced the previous Supabase connection strings with NeonDB serverless PostgreSQL. This solved the persistent "egress limit exhausted" issue experienced under high continuous data loads.
- **Backend Redeployment:** Reconfigured and redeployed the Node.js backend on Render to seamlessly synchronize with the new NeonDB architecture without downtime.

---

### 🟢 Phase 12 — Advanced UI Enhancements & Feature Additions

Focused on polishing the dashboard user experience with premium aesthetics and refined data interactions.
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Implemented modern, premium glassmorphism styling across all sensor cards, the Live AQI banner, and the Alert History panel.
- **Master Graph Refinement:** Restored the 24-hour predictive and historical overlap chart to use clean, single-color line rendering for improved readability.
- **PDF Export Optimization:** Enhanced the "Export PDF" functionality to intelligently capture only the graphical charts and summary cards, automatically excluding the raw data tables.

---
## 📡 Production API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/update` | Insert new sensor reading from ESP32 |
| `GET` | `/api/latest` | Fetch the most recent reading |
| `GET` | `/api/history` | Fetch all historical readings |

---

## 🗄️ Database Design (Production)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
    id          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    temperature FLOAT,
    humidity    FLOAT,
    air_quality INT,
    created_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## 🔄 Full Data Flow

```
1.  ESP32 initializes and reads sensors
2.  ESP32 connects to WiFi network
3.  DHT11 provides Temperature + Humidity readings
4.  MQ135 provides Air Quality Index (AQI) reading
5.  ESP32 constructs JSON payload
6.  ESP32 sends HTTPS POST → Render Backend
7.  Backend validates and sanitizes data
8.  Data is inserted into NeonDB PostgreSQL (Serverless)
9.  Frontend polls  GET /api/latest  → updates sensor cards
10. Frontend polls  GET /api/history → updates graphs + table
11. AQI threshold checked → alert banner shown if needed
12. EmailJS / SMS gateway triggered if threshold breached
13. LOOP repeats every 5 seconds
```
